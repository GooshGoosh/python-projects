'''
eldenRingOOP.py - Mini Elden Ring-based game that lets the user
the tutorial boss Solder of Godrick and a majority of the field,
mini, and main bosses from Elden Ring. Uses a random die roll of
1-20 to decide if the Tarnished was able to attack the boss and
dodge/block the boss' attack.
Allows class selection via pyinputplus module and a list of .json
files stored in elden_ring/classes. The .json file contains the
class name followed by each stat and their values for each Elden
Ring starting class (e.g. Vig: 0).
The stats are followed by the 6 equipment slots for the character
including Right Hand, Left Hand, Helm, Torso, Wrists, and Legs.
