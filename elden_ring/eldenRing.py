# eldenRing.py - Mini Elden Ring-based game that lets the user fight the tutorial boss Soldier of Godrick
# and a majority of the field, mini, and main bosses from Elden Ring. Uses random numbers to decide if the Tarnished won/lost the fight.
#
# TODO:
# Similar to rock, paper, scissors; The player chooses either 'Attack', 'Block', or 'Roll' as an action.
# The boss will randomly get assigned 'Quick Attack', 'Delay Attack', 'Grab Attack'. 
# The winning order is as follows:
# Attack > Delay Attack, Attack = Quick Attack, Attack = Grab Attack
# Block > Quick Attack, Block > Delay Attack, Block < Grab Attack
# Roll > Quick Attack, Roll > Grab Attack, Roll > Delay Attack
#
# Allows class selection via pyinputplus module and a list of .csv files stored in /home/user/Documents/elden_ring/classes.
# The .csv file contains the class name followed by each stat and their values for each Elden Ring starting class (e.g. Vig,0).
# The stats are followed by the 6 equipment slots for the character including Right Hand, Left Hand, Helm, Torso, Wrists, and Legs.
